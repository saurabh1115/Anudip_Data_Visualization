# Polymorphism with Inheritance

# Polymorphism lets us define methods in the child class that have the same name as the methods in the parent class.
# In inheritance, the child class inherits the methods from the parent class.
# However, it is possible to modify a method in a child class that it has inherited from the parent class. 
# This is particularly useful in cases where the method inherited from the parent class doesn't quite fit the child class. 
# In such cases, we re-implement the method in the child class. 
# This process of re-implementing a method in the child class is known as MethodÂ Overriding.

In the small town of Willowbrook, where the rolling hills met the edge of a whispering forest, there stood an old lighthouse. It hadn't been used for decades, but every evening, just before twilight faded into night, the townspeople would see a soft, golden light emanating from its top. They knew it wasn't functional; the light was just an old lantern, but it held a special place in their hearts.
